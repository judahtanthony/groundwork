# Phase 5 — Bounded Autonomy: implementation progress log

Autonomous execution of the Phase 5 leaf chain (ADRs 0054–0058) on
`phase-5-bounded-autonomy`. One entry per landed leaf; build/test green at each step.

- **T-1067** role-aware actors (ADR 0055) — added planner/coding/reviewer AI actors;
  `human.owner` holds all roles; `require_roles` is now a policy→approval input
  (gate `Decision.RequiredRoles` from the firing rule, recorded on the approval).
  Tests: gate required-roles + role-scoped match; approval records required role.
- **T-1010** reversibility as highest-bar condition (ADR 0038) — removed the
  pre-policy short-circuit in `gate.Evaluate`; irreversible actions now flow through
  rule evaluation and are passable only by an auto_approve rule that explicitly opts
  in (`when.reversible: false`), else `require_human`. Shipped defaults preserve
  prior behavior exactly. Tests: opt-in auto-approves; reversible-only/unqualified
  rules still gate.
- **T-1011** first-class `amend_policy` / `elevate_autonomy` action types (ADR 0038)
  — added the two approval types (Valid + human-gated set); they flow through the
  same gate engine and default to `require_human`. Authority elevation is now
  *expressible* without being *enabled*. Tests: types valid; default require_human.
- **T-1012** wire earned autonomy via `AutonomyRequires` (ADR 0038) — `autonomyOutcome`
  now honors a per-work-type elevation's prerequisites (named SOP present, required
  validations passed) read from new `Action.SatisfiedSOPs`/`PassedValidations`; unmet
  prerequisites fall back to require_human. Absent requirements stay back-compat.
  Tests: elevation gated when unmet, applies when met.
